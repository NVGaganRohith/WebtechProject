                <p>
                    <h3>What a Keto diet is ?</h3>
                    <img align="right" src="https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/articles/health_tools/whats_a_ketogenic_diet_slideshow/493ss_thinkstock_rf_foods_high_in_protein.jpg"></img>
                    </br>
                    The ketogenic diet is a very low carb, high fat diet that shares many similarities with the Atkins and low carb diets.</br>
                    </br>
                    It involves drastically reducing carbohydrate intake and replacing it with fat. This reduction in carbs puts your body into a metabolic state called ketosis.</br>
                    </br>
                    When this happens, your body becomes incredibly efficient at burning fat for energy. It also turns fat into ketones in the liver, which can supply energy for the brain.</br>
                    </br>
                    Ketogenic diets can cause significant reductions in blood sugar and insulin levels. This, along with the increased ketones, has some health benefits.</br>
                    </br>
                    <h3>Types of Keto diets</h3>
                    </br>
                    There are several versions of the ketogenic diet, including:</br>
                    </br>
                    <b>Standard ketogenic diet (SKD):</b> This is a very low carb, moderate protein and high fat diet. It typically contains 70% fat, 20% protein, and only 10% carbs.</br>
                    </br>
                    <b>Cyclical ketogenic diet (CKD):</b> This diet involves periods of higher carb refeeds, such as 5 ketogenic days followed by 2 high carb days.</br>
                    </br>
                    <b>Targeted ketogenic diet (TKD):</b> This diet allows you to add carbs around workouts.</br>
                    </br>
                    High protein ketogenic diet: This is similar to a standard ketogenic diet, but includes more protein. The ratio is often 60% fat, 35% protein, and 5% carbs.</br>
                    </br>
                    However, only the standard and high protein ketogenic diets have been studied extensively. Cyclical or targeted ketogenic diets are more advanced methods and primarily used by bodybuilders or athletes.</br>
                    </br>
                    The information in this article mostly applies to the standard ketogenic diet (SKD), although many of the same principles also apply to the other versions.</br>
                    </br>
                    <h3>Other health benefits of keto</h3>
                    </br>
                    The ketogenic diet actually originated as a tool for treating neurological diseases such as epilepsy.</br>
                    </br>
                    Studies have now shown that the diet can have benefits for a wide variety of different health conditions:</br>
                    </br>
                    <b>Heart disease:</b> The ketogenic diet can help improve risk factors like body fat, HDL (good) cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and blood sugar.</br>
                    </br>
                    <b>Cancer:</b> The diet is currently being explored as an additional treatment for cancer, because it may help slow tumor growth.</br>
                    </br>
                    <b>Alzheimer’s disease:</b> The keto diet may help reduce symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease and slow its progression.</br>
                    </br>
                    <b>Epilepsy:</b> Research has shown that the ketogenic diet can cause significant reductions in seizures in epileptic children.</br>
                    </br>
                    <b>Parkinson’s disease:</b> Although more research is needed, one study found that the diet helped improve symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.</br>
                    </br>
                    <b>Polycystic ovary syndrome:</b> The ketogenic diet can help reduce insulin levels, which may play a key role in polycystic ovary syndrome.</br>
                    </br>
                    <b>Brain injuries:</b> Some research suggests that the diet could improve outcomes of traumatic brain injuries.</br>
                    </br>
                    <b>Weight:</b> Ketogenic diets can help you lose weight.</br>
                    </br>
                    However, keep in mind that research into many of these areas is far from conclusive.</br>

                    <h3>Benifits</h3>
                    </br>
                    In addition to aiding weight loss, protein provides the body with some essential benefits. The benefits of protein include:</br>
                    </br>
                    <ul>

                        <li>Providing enzymes that help power thousands of chemical reactions throughout the body</li>
                        <li>Helping the body maintain and repair hair, skin, muscles, and bones</li>
                        <li>Certain proteins are necessary to produce hormones that help the body’s organs and cells communicate</li>
                    </ul>
                    </br>
                    Protein also provides amino acids. There are 22 amino acids, nine of which are essential to obtain from the diet because the body does not produce them.</br>
                    </br>
                    Protein from animals tends to contain all of the amino acids, so people refer to it as a complete</br>
                    </br>
                    protein. In contrast, many plant proteins only provide some of the amino acids, meaning that </br>
                    </br>
                    people need to combine them with other protein sources to get all of the essential amino acids.</br>
                    </br>
                    <h3>How to eat a high-protein diet</h3>
                    There are many possible ways to include more protein in the diet, even for those with other dietary restrictions.</br>
                    </br>
                    For example, people who follow a vegetarian or vegan diet or those who avoid dairy can still eat a high-protein diet.</br>
                    </br>
                    People can either adjust their current diet to include more protein or follow a specific high-protein diet plan.</br>
                    </br>
                    Taking the steps below may help a person when they start a high-protein diet:</br>
                    </br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>figuring out their individual protein needs, which will depend on their body weight</li>
                        <li>making meal plans for the week</li>
                        <li>finding and using high-quality proteins</li>
                        <li>including at least 25–30 grams of protein in each meal</li>
                        <li>keeping a food journal to track the amount and types of food that they eat</li>
                        <li>eating well-balanced meals</li>
                        <li>including both plant and lean animal sources of protein in the diet</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                    <h3>What a low-carb diet is ?</h3>
                    Your food choices depend on a few things, including how healthy you are, how much you exercise and how much weight you have to lose.</br>
                    </br>
                    Consider this meal plan as a general guideline, not something written in stone.</br>
                    </br>
                    <b>Eat:</b> Meat, fish, eggs, vegetables, fruit, nuts, seeds, high-fat dairy, fats, healthy oils and maybe even some tubers and non-gluten grains.</br>
                    </br>
                    <b>Don’t eat:</b> Sugar, HFCS, wheat, seed oils, trans fats, “diet” and low-fat products and highly processed foods.</br>
                    </br>
                    <h3>Foods to Avoid</h3>
                    You should avoid these six food groups and nutrients, in order of importance:</br>
                    </br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Sugar:</b> Soft drinks, fruit juices, agave, candy, ice cream and many other products that contain added sugar.</li>
                        <li><b>Refined grains:</b> Wheat, rice, barley and rye, as well as bread, cereal and pasta.</li>
                        <li><b>Trans fats:</b> Hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated oils.</li>
                        <li><b>Diet and low-fat products:</b> Many dairy products, cereals or crackers are fat-reduced, but contain added sugar.</li>
                        <li><b>Highly processed foods:</b> If it looks like it was made in a factory, don’t eat it.</li>
                        <li><b>Starchy vegetables:</b> It’s best to limit starchy vegetables in your diet if you’re following a very low-carb diet.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <b> You must read ingredient lists even on foods labelled as health foods.</b></br>
                    </br>

                <p>
                    <h3>What a vegetarian diet is</h3>
                    A well-planned vegetarian diet is a healthy way to meet your nutritional needs. Find out</br>
                    </br>
                    what you need to know about a plant-based diet. Vegetarian diets continue to increase in </br>
                    </br>
                    popularity.Reasons for following a vegetarian diet are varied but include health benefits,</br>
                    </br>
                    such as reducing your risk of heart disease, diabetes and some cancers.</br>
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    Yet some vegetarians rely too heavily on processed foods, which can be high in calories, sugar, fat and sodium.</br>
                    </br>
                    And they may not eat enough fruits, vegetables, whole grains and calcium-rich foods, thus missing out on </br>
                    </br>
                    the nutrients they provide.</br>
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    However, with a little planning a vegetarian diet can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children,</br>
                    </br>
                    teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you </br>
                    </br>
                    plan a diet that meets them.</br>
                    </br>
                    <h3>Types of vegetarian diets</h3>
                    </br>
                    When people think about a vegetarian diet, they typically think about a diet that doesn't include meat, poultry or fish.</br>
                    </br>
                    But vegetarian diets vary in what foods they include and exclude:</br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Lacto-vegetarian:</b> diets exclude meat, fish, poultry and eggs, as well as foods that contain them. Dairy products, such as milk, cheese, yogurt and butter, are included.</li>
                        <li><b>Ovo-vegetarian:</b> diets exclude meat, poultry, seafood and dairy products, but allow eggs.</li>
                        <li><b>Lacto-ovo:</b> vegetarian diets exclude meat, fish and poultry, but allow dairy products and eggs.</li>
                        <li><b>Pescatarian:</b> diets exclude meat and poultry, dairy, and eggs, but allow fish.</li>
                        <li><b>Vegan:</b> diets exclude meat, poultry, fish, eggs and dairy products — and foods that contain these products.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Some people follow a semivegetarian diet — also called a flexitarian diet — which is primarily a plant-based diet but</br>
                    </br>
                    includes meat, dairy, eggs, poultry and fish on occasion or in small quantities.</br>

                <p>
                    <h3>Why choose a low fat diet?</h3>
                    </br>
                    The primary reasons for choosing a low fat diet tend to be to help reduce overall calorie intake and to improve cholesterol levels.</br>
                    </br>
                    To help achieve these aims a low fat diet should be appropriately balanced to include a healthy amount of vitamins and minerals.</br>
                    </br>
                    <h3>Low fat diet foods</h3>

                    Typically a low fat diet will include foods such as:</br>
                    </br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Whole grain foods</b> – such as oats and higher fibre versions of pasta, rice and bread</li>
                        <li><b>Lean meats</b> – such as skinless chicken and turkey</li>
                        <li><b>White fish</b></li>
                        <li><b>Reduced fat dairy</b> – skimmed milk and low fat yoghurt and cheese</li>
                        <li><b>Vegetables</b></li>
                        <li><b>entils</b></li>
                        <li><b>Fruit</b></li>
                    </ul>
                    </br>
                    <h3>Fatty foods to avoid or reduce</h3>
                    Typically a low fat diet will involve reducing fat intake from foods such as butter, eggs and cheese.</br>
                    </br>
                    Other foods containing relatively high quantities of fat include salad dressings, certain sauces and pastry and sponge based foods.</br>
                    </br>
